# Contact Keeper (Laravel)

<p>This is a project from Brad Traversy's "React Front to Back" course but is using php/laravel as a backend as that's currently my focus.</p>

<p>All code from the NodeJs sections of the project will be converted to function exactly the same but in php.</p>

<p>The NodeJs code will not be included.</p>
